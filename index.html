       <p style="font-size: 32px">My Interest In IT</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">
            I had always had an interest in technology in general, much of that stems from how much of it surrounded me growing up, and i always thought it was cool, for some reason, this was probably
            because my father works in IT. Growing up I also enjoyed creating things, using basic game making engines such as gamemaker and rpgmaker among others, and more recently, videos. In year 12, 
            I decided to do Software Development in secondary school and I really enjoyed it and i'm glad i decided to do it, something about it was really enjoyable and satisfying, debugging and getting 
            code you wrote to run.
            
            I had chosen to go to RMIT because of a few different reasons, the commute to RMIT was the most convenient, I had heard the IT courses here were really good and my sisters come here
            Through my studies I expect to learn a myriad of skills all relating to information technology and the nuances many don't think of when it comes to Information Technology, for example,
            databases is a topic, which I had not even thought about when looking at this course's information
