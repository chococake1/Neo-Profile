    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Basic Information About Me</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            Hello my name is Neo Ta, I am of Vietnamese and Cambodian descent, from my father and mother respectively. I studied in Werribee Secondary College.
            Hobbbies of mine include playing games, playing piano and making videos of whatever I feel like making (though i'm not that good either).
            I cook once a week so I like to think i'm good at it.<br>
            I also have 3 cats, very epico.

    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">My Interest In IT</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            I had always had an interest in technology in general, much of that stems from how much of it surrounded me growing up, and i always thought it was cool, for some reason, this was probably
            because my father works in IT. Growing up I also enjoyed creating things, using basic game making engines such as gamemaker and rpgmaker among others, and more recently, videos. 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            In year 12, I decided to do Software Development in secondary school as IT had always fascinated me, and I really enjoyed it and i'm glad i decided to do it, something about it was really 
            enjoyable and satisfying, debugging and getting code you wrote to run.
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            I had chosen to come to RMIT because of a few different reasons, the commute to RMIT was convenient, I had heard the IT courses here were really solid and my sisters come here
            Through my studies I expect to learn a myriad of skills all relating to information technology and the nuances many don't think of when it comes to Information Technology, for example,
            databases is a topic, which I had not even thought about when looking at this course's information.
      
    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Ideal Job</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            My ideal job would either be something to do with software development, or cyber security, for example working at a company like this*put thing here* at Lextech Pty Ltd. This position is that 
            of a software developer, this position is so appealing to me because of how satisfying it sounds, working in a smaller group makes it easier to connect with others, something I would want 
            in a job, being able to communicate with others. Around $100,000 yearly income is also a good amount. Other jobs I also would enjoy would be something to do with game development or something to
            do with digital media. Though I ultimately chose this course out of the three because of the stability it has as opposed to the other two and how appicable a skill like IT could be.
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            The skills required for this position are stated, some of the points mentioned include experience in using SQL or T-SQL, the ability to code in C#, .NET Core and ASP.NET. Other skills required
            include experience in web development technologies, such as JavaScript libraries, HTML and CSS.<br>
            The skills I currently have out of the required skills is little, HTML (which I only know about through making this - really basic) and similarly basic .VS coding, which I did in secondary school.<br>
            I plan on obtaining these skills by working at different jobs, obtaining skills as I do other jobs and possibly personal learning.
                                                     
    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Personal Profile</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am a Turbulent Mediator, with a code of INFP-T, a role of a Diplomat and a strategy of Constant Improvement. I mostly agree with these results,
            especially the INFP-T code,  I do see myself someone who is more introverted, basing actions on feeling, a very prospecting person and turbulent to an extent, I do get bursts of
            motivation to improve at certain skills, but not as much as the result would imply.
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px"> 
            I am a visual learner according to an online quiz, this result I somewhat disagree with as I think of myself as someone who enjoys more hands on learning.
            According to a psychometric quiz on how others percieve me, I am the "Lively Centre of Attention", which I can partially see, but only agree with about half of the result, I do see 
            myself as more optimistic and uplifting around others, I do not see myself as someone in the centre of attention in many cases.
