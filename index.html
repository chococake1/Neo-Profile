       <p style="font-size: 32px">My Interest In IT</p>
        <p style="font-size: 18px">I had always had an interest in technology in general, much of that stems from how much of it surrounded me growing up, and i always thought it was cool, for some reason, this was probably
            because my father works in IT.
