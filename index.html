    <p style="font-size: 32px">Basic Information About Me</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Hello my name is Neo Ta, I am of Vietnamese and Cambodian descent, from my father and mother respectively. I studied in Werribee Secondary College.
            Hobbbies of mine include playing games, playing piano and making videos of whatever I feel like making (though i'm not that good either).
            I cook once a week so I like to think i'm good at it. I also have 3 cats, very epico.

    <p style="font-size: 32px">My Interest In IT</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            I had always had an interest in technology in general, much of that stems from how much of it surrounded me growing up, and i always thought it was cool, for some reason, this was probably
            because my father works in IT. Growing up I also enjoyed creating things, using basic game making engines such as gamemaker and rpgmaker among others, and more recently, videos. 
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            In year 12, I decided to do Software Development in secondary school as IT had always fascinated me, and I really enjoyed it and i'm glad i decided to do it, something about it was really 
            enjoyable and satisfying, debugging and getting code you wrote to run.
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            I had chosen to come to RMIT because of a few different reasons, the commute to RMIT was convenient, I had heard the IT courses here were really solid and my sisters come here
            Through my studies I expect to learn a myriad of skills all relating to information technology and the nuances many don't think of when it comes to Information Technology, for example,
            databases is a topic, which I had not even thought about when looking at this course's information.

    <p style="font-size: 32px">Personal Profile</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am a Turbulent Mediator, with a code of INFP-T, a role of a Diplomat and a strategy of Constant Improvement. I mostly agree with these results,
            especially the INFP-T code,  I do see myself someone who is more introverted, basing actions on feeling, a very prospecting person and turbulent to an extent, I do get bursts of
            motivation to improve at certain skills, but not as much as the result would imply.
        <p style="font-size: 20px"> 
            I am a visual learner according to an online quiz, this result I somewhat disagree with as I think of myself as someone who enjoys more hands on learning.
            According to a psychometric quiz on how others percieve me, I am the "Lively Centre of Attention", which I can partially see, but only agree with about haalf of the result, I do see 
            myself as more optimistic and uplifting around others, I do not see myself as someone in the centre of attention in many cases.
