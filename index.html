    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Basic Information About Me</p>
    <div><p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            My name is Neo Ta, I am of Vietnamese and Cambodian descent, from my father and mother respectively. I studied in Werribee Secondary College.
            Hobbies of mine include playing games, playing piano and making videos of whatever I feel like making (though I'm not that good either).
            I cook once a week, so I like to think I'm good at it.<br>
            I also have 3 cats, very epico.</div>

    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">My Interest In IT</p>
        <div><p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            I had always had an interest in technology in general, much of that stems from how much of it surrounded me growing up, and i always thought it was cool, for some reason, this was probably
            because my father works in IT. Growing up, I also enjoyed creating things, using basic game making engines such as gamemaker and rpgmaker among others, and more recently, videos. 
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            In year 12, I decided to do Software Development in secondary school as IT had always fascinated me, and I really enjoyed it and i'm glad i decided to do it, something about it was really 
            enjoyable and satisfying, debugging and getting code you wrote to run.
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            I had chosen to come to RMIT because of a few different reasons, the commute to RMIT was convenient, I had heard the IT courses here were really solid and my sisters come here
            Through my studies I expect to learn a myriad of skills all relating to information technology and the nuances many don't think of when it comes to Information Technology, for example,
            practical databases is a topic, which I had not even thought about when looking at this course's information.</div>
      
    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Ideal Job</p>
        <div><p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            My ideal job would either be something to do with software development, or cyber security, for example working at a company like this*put thing here* at Lextech Pty Ltd. This position is that 
            of a software developer, this position is so appealing to me because of how satisfying it sounds, working in a smaller group makes it easier to connect with others, something I would want 
            in a job, being able to communicate with others. Around $100,000 yearly income is also a good amount. Other jobs I also would enjoy would be something to do with game development or something to
            do with digital media. Though I ultimately chose this course out of the three because of the stability it has as opposed to the other two and how appicable a skill like IT could be.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            The skills required for this position are stated, some of the points mentioned include experience in using SQL or T-SQL, the ability to code in C#, .NET Core and ASP.NET. Other skills required
            include experience in web development technologies, such as JavaScript libraries, HTML and CSS.<br>
            The skills I currently have out of the required skills is little, HTML (which I only know about through making this - really basic) and similarly basic .VS coding, which I did in secondary school.<br>
            I plan on obtaining these skills by working at different jobs, obtaining skills as I do other jobs and possibly personal learning.</div>

    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Personal Profile</p>
        <div><p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am a Turbulent Mediator, with a code of INFP-T, a role of a Diplomat and a strategy of Constant Improvement. I mostly agree with these results,
            especially the INFP-T code,  I do see myself someone who is more introverted, basing actions on feeling, a very prospecting person and turbulent to an extent, I do get bursts of
            motivation to improve at certain skills, but not as much as the result would imply.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px"> 
            I am a visual learner according to an online quiz, this result I somewhat disagree with as I think of myself as someone who enjoys more hands on learning.
            According to a psychometric quiz on how others percieve me, I am the "Lively Centre of Attention", which I can partially see, but only agree with about half of the result, I do see 
            myself as more optimistic and uplifting around others, I do not see myself as someone in the centre of attention in many cases.</div>
          
    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px"><b>Project Idea</b></p>
    <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Overview</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            My project idea is a vacation planner, it allows users to plan a vacation or a trip out. Users will have the ability to set a budget, view time/distance (and possibly traffic) between locations,
            set the amount of people joining in the trip, write what they are bringing on the trip and create checklists. Most obviously planning what to do and for how long. Users will also be able to view 
            previous trips and login to be used across several devices, users will be able to share the trip to other people. Users may also view and share previous trips.
          
      <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Motivation</p>
          <div><p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            Recently, me and my family have been going out on trips spanning the entire day. Scheduling how we would spend our day has always been the most difficult part, we would write it 
            on excel, which was inefficient and awkward to use. Among my project ideas; a puzzle game based off of Tetris involving words for fun 
            (I ultimately decided that this wouldn't particularly solve a problem and is better suited as a personal project) and an application for companies that would be used to sort inventory
            (This one whilst possibly good for a learning experience, didn't seem that interesting to me), a vacation scheduling application felt the most viable for what skills I expect to learn. 
            Yet ambitious enough that the project will provide a good challenge and learning experience. This was a problem I thought would have a market, as restrictions around the world are loosening.</div>
          
      <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Description</p>
       <div>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            The application would allow users to do several things to plan out a vacation, from a single day out to an entire trip. Its' features include the ability for users to register and log in. This also
            means that users are able to login and view their data from separate devices. The application will be usable with both mobile phones and computers, for ease of viewing (most importantly, when on the trip)
            and more users. Users are also able to use the application to set locations and the order they would be travelled to. The application will give estimates on how long getting from location to location, 
            using data from google maps, taking traffic into consideration, users are able to adjust this time if they want. Users may also make a checklist of what they want to do, which can be checked off by the user. 
            Users will be able to view previous trips and also set the amount of people on the trip (extra details like each person's name and faces are optional, putting other people in your trip plans is also possible. 
            Users can share future, current and previous trips with each other, the plan can be exported as a PDF upon request. Users may also set a budget, planning/estimating how much they wish to spend in specific. 
            Users are also able to create a list of what they are bringing on the trip, the quantity, names and descriptions of these items are made by the user.
      <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            A log out feature simply allows users to log out of their account, returning to the login/home screen
            areas and/or in total.          
            The presentation of the application will make use of logos/images to more intuitively convey the uses of the services many functions. Examples of logos used would be the standard door to symbolise logging out,
            features in menus acced via the three line symbol (Hamburger button), a cog to direct users to the settings, etc.. Colours would ideally be those that are  easy to look at and viewable, most especially important 
            on smaller devices like mobile phones. Colours would be low in brightness and contrast and fonts will be in darker colours to help the readability.
      <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            One online trip planner which I tested navigating around was inspirock. Some of the features were more difficult to navigate around/get, features like setting budgets were more difficult to find/make. 
            The presentation of this website is well made, with a minimalist approach which is easy to read, colour is used sparingly and primarily for images. Another website I tested navigating around was wanderlog. 
            This site had many similarities to inspirock, a more minimalist approach, however using more colours outside of images. It was missing some features present in inspirock. Features like more user customization, 
            through colours and structure were present, which I had not considered in my own design idea.
            
      <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Tools and Technologies</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            Software needed would be something like fluidui to plan the user interface and/or application to see how to looks and navigates. The software to create this website/application could be in Unity, Visual Studio 
            or Python, though it is not confirmed what will be used as I do not currently have the knowledge to confirm what will be used or what would be suited to website/application like this. 
            
      <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Skills Required</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            Skills required include learning the relevant coding language required to write this application/website. The feasibility of these skills is alright, if my skills as a developer are able to keep up with the 
            desired features of this project, the project should be extremely possible. I should already have the hardware required to run the coding application, meaning it should not be a problem, No special hardware should be 
            requred, however if this were to be hosted as a website, that is when issues of the need of special hardware may become an issue.
          
      <p style="font-size: 32px; margin-left: 40px">Outcome</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-left: 40px">
            If this project were to be successful, It realistically would not make much of an impact on the market. The product would provide as another solution for the problem of planning a vacation. Sadly, whilst this 
            market is large, there are several other similar products, differing only slightly and none of which, including this one having little to make it stand out amongst the crowd. I will however, have developed
            many skills in making an application/website.
